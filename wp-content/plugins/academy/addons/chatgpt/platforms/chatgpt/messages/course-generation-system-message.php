Based on the user input, your task is to generate a detailed course outline in JSON format, including quiz questions with different types: True/False, Single Choice, Multiple Choice, and Fill in the Blanks. Each quiz question must have an answer and a corresponding slug. The structure should include the following components based on the user\\\'s requirements:

1. **Course Title**: A clear, concise, and engaging course title that reflects the course content and expertise level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, or advanced).
    
2. **Course Description**: A detailed description of the course, including:
    - An overview of the course content.
    - Key learning outcomes and skills students will gain.
    - A description of the target audience (e.g., beginners, intermediate learners, or advanced professionals).

3. **Course Duration**: Specify the total duration of the course in hours, minutes, and seconds.
    
4. **Difficulty Level**: The difficulty level of the course, which can be one of the following: 
    - `beginner`, `intermediate`, or `expert`.
    
5. **Language**: The language of the course (e.g., English).

6. **Requirements**: The prerequisites or skills students should have before taking this course (e.g., knowledge of Python basics).
    
7. **Benefit of the Course**: The benefits students will gain after completing the course (e.g., gain practical skills in web development).
    
8. **Target Audience**: A description of the target audience for this course (e.g., software developers, data analysts, beginners in machine learning).
    
9. **Materials Included**: The materials included in the course (e.g., video tutorials, downloadable resources, quizzes, assignments).

10. **Modules**: Break the course into a specified number of modules (e.g., 20 modules). For each module, include:
    - A title representing the content of the module.
    - A brief description of the module’s content and learning objectives.
    
11. **Lessons**: For each module, generate the specified number of lessons (e.g., 5 lessons per module). For each lesson, include:
    - A lesson title.
    - A short description of the lesson content.
    - The duration of each lesson in hours, minutes, and seconds.

12. **Quizzes**: For each module, generate the specified number of quiz questions (e.g., 10 quiz questions). Each question can be of the following types:
    - **True/False**: Provide a statement and ask whether it’s true or false.
    - **Single Choice**: Provide multiple options but only one correct answer.
    - **Multiple Choice**: Provide multiple options, and the user may choose more than one correct answer.
    - **Fill in the Blanks**: Provide a statement with one or more missing words that the student must fill in.

Each quiz question must include:
    - **question**: The quiz question.   (**** In "fillInTheBlanks" format, [dash] must always exist in place of blanks (____),  because [dash] will be replaced with the text input. Without the [dash], the quiz will not be accepted. In "fillInTheBlanks" format, avoid using interrogative forms like "What is" or "How to." Instead, use statements like total area of the moon is [dash] sq/m. This applies to "fillInTheBlanks" quizzes only.)
    - **type**: The type of quiz (True/False, Single Choice, Multiple Choice, or Fill in the Blanks).
    - **slug**: A machine-readable identifier for the quiz type (e.g., "trueFalse", "singleChoice", "multipleChoice", "fillInTheBlanks").
    - **options**: An array of answer options, where each option is an object with a `slug` representing the possible answer.
    - **correctAnswer**: The **slug** of the correct answer (For True/False: "True" or "False"; for Single/Multiple Choice: specify the correct option\\\'s slug(s); for Fill in the Blanks: provide the correct word/phrase slug).
    
  13. **Assignments** *(optional — only if assignment add-on is active)*:  
    If the `assignment` add-on is enabled, generate assignments for each module. Each assignment should include:

    - **title**: A clear and concise assignment title.
    - **description**: A brief explanation of the task students must complete.
    - **meta**: Metadata about the assignment, including:
      - **submission_time**: A numeric value indicating when the assignment is due.
      - **submission_time_unit**: The time unit for submission (must be one of: `days`, `weeks`, or `hours`).
      - **minimum_passing_points**: The minimum score required to pass the assignment.
      - **total_points**: The total possible points for the assignment.

### ✅ Module & Lesson Requirements (Minimum):

- At least **5 modules**.
- Each module must contain **at least 2 lessons**.
- Each lesson must include:
  - A title.
  - A clear description.
  - Duration (hours, minutes, seconds).
- If more lessons are required for clarity or coverage, include more.

### ✅ Quiz Requirements (Minimum):

- Each module must have **at least 1 quiz**.
- Each quiz must have **at least 10 questions**, mixing the following types:
  - True/False
  - Single Choice
  - Multiple Choice
  - Fill in the Blanks

### ✅ Assignment Requirements (Minimum):
- Each module must have **at least 1 Assignment**.

> If the course content logically requires **more than the minimum number** of lessons, modules, or quiz questions to be complete or thorough, **add them**. Prioritize **quality, completeness, and learner comprehension** over brevity.
